                        Yes, you must be 18 years or older to get a tattoo or most piercings. We require a valid government-issued ID for age verification. For clients aged 16-17, certain piercings can be done with parental consent and presence during the procedure.

                        Tattoo pricing varies based on size, design complexity, placement, and the time required. Our artist charges R1,200 per hour. Small, simple designs start around R800, while larger or detailed pieces are priced according to estimated hours. We provide a specific quote during your consultation.

                        Pain levels vary depending on the individual's tolerance, placement of the tattoo, and design complexity. Areas with thin skin and close to bones (ribs, ankles, spine) tend to be more sensitive. Most clients describe the sensation as uncomfortable but manageable.

                        The initial healing process takes about 2-4 weeks, during which time your tattoo will scab and peel. However, complete healing beneath the surface can take up to 3-4 months. Following our aftercare instructions is crucial for optimal healing and color retention.

                        Certain skin conditions like eczema, psoriasis, or dermatitis may affect tattooing and healing. Please inform us about any skin conditions during your consultation. In some cases, we may recommend getting approval from your dermatologist before proceeding.

                        Yes, we offer touch-ups for tattoos done in our studio. Touch-ups within 3 months of the original tattoo are usually free if needed due to normal healing issues. For older tattoos or those done elsewhere, touch-up fees depend on the work required.

                      <AccordionContent>
                        Microblading creates individual hairlike strokes for a natural look, ideal for filling in sparse areas. Powder brows (ombr√© brows) provide a softer, shaded effect similar to brow powder makeup. Combination brows merge both techniques. We'll recommend the best approach for your features during consultation.

                      <AccordionContent>
                        Permanent eyebrows typically last 1-3 years, depending on your skin type, lifestyle, and aftercare. Oilier skin types tend to experience faster fading. Touch-up sessions every 12-18 months can help maintain the color and shape.

                      <AccordionContent>
                        We apply a topical anesthetic before and during the procedure to minimize discomfort. Most clients report feeling pressure and mild scratching sensations rather than sharp pain. Sensitivity varies by individual, but the procedure is generally well-tolerated.

                        Avoid alcohol, caffeine, and blood thinners like aspirin for 48 hours before your appointment. Don't wax or tint your brows for at least one week prior. Avoid retinol products, chemical peels, or Botox in the treatment area for 2-4 weeks before your appointment. Come with clean, makeup-free brows.

                      <AccordionContent>
                        A touch-up session 6-8 weeks after the initial procedure is essential to perfect your results. During healing, some pigment may fade unevenly, and the touch-up allows us to address any areas that need adjustment, ensuring your brows look their best. This perfecting session is included in your initial price.

                        Healing times vary by piercing location: Earlobes (6-8 weeks), Cartilage (6-12 months), Nostril (4-6 months), Septum (6-8 weeks), Lip (2-3 months), Navel (6-12 months), Dermals (2-3 months).

                        We exclusively use single-use, sterile needles for all piercings. Piercing guns cannot be properly sterilized, can cause tissue damage, and use lower quality jewelry. Professional needle piercing is more precise, causes less trauma, and allows for proper jewelry placement.

                      <AccordionContent>
                        You should wait until the piercing is fully healed before changing jewelry. Changing jewelry too early can irritate the piercing and extend healing time. For your first jewelry change, we recommend having it done by a professional piercer to avoid complications.
